Usage:
  network-diagnostics [summary]
  network-diagnostics interfaces
  network-diagnostics sockets
  network-diagnostics dns NAME
  network-diagnostics route IP
  network-diagnostics tools

Commands:
  summary     Local link, address, route, DNS, NetworkManager and socket state.
  interfaces  Interface, address, Wi-Fi and link information.
  sockets     Listening TCP/UDP sockets.
  dns NAME    Query the configured resolver plus A, AAAA and DNSSEC-aware data.
  route IP    Show the kernel route selected for an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  tools       Show the diagnostic tools provided by GjallarOS.

Packet capture, active scanning and throughput testing remain explicit operator
actions through tcpdump, tshark, termshark, nmap, iperf3 and the other raw tools.
